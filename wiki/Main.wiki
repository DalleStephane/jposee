jPOS is a JavaÂ® platform-based, mission-critical financial transaction library/framework that can be customized and extended in order to implement financial interchanges.

jPOS Extended Edition Software Development Kit goes one step beyond jPOS by providing a development environment with a growing set of proven, ready-to-deploy components based on jPOS' best practices.
